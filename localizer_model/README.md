# 🪐 spaCy Project: Classification of locations as destination and departure

**This project was created as part of a epitech project T-AIA-901.

## 📋 project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the

### ⏯ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | download the french vectors language |
| `assemble` | assemble a spaCy model with pretrained vectors, a regex matcher and a language detector component |
| `assemble_xgb` | assemble a spaCy model with pretrained vectors, a xgboost classifier and a language detector component |
| `corpus` | Create a training and dev set from the manually annotated data |
| `evaluate` | Final evaluation on the dev data and printing the results |
| `evaluate_xgb` | Final evaluation on the dev data and printing the results |
| `setup` | Install dependencies |

### ⏭ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `setup` &rarr; `download` &rarr;  `assemble` &rarr; `assemble_xgb` &rarr; `corpus` &rarr; `evaluate` &rarr; `evaluate_xgb` |

### 🗂 Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/patterns_destination.jsonl`](assets/patterns_destination.jsonl) | Local | The patterns for destination locations |
| [`assets/patterns_departure.jsonl`](assets/entities.csv) | Local | The patterns for departure locations |
| [`assets/patterns_step.jsonl`](assets/patterns_step.txt) | Local | The patterns for step locations |
| [`assets/data.csv`](assets/data.csv) | Local | The labelled data: It is generated by a gsheet shared across epitech |
